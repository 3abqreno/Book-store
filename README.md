# book-trading-website
have you ever thought of searching for a book and found it a hastle to buy multiple books from multiple stores ?
well we made a solution, a website like uber eats but for books! 
stores can open and display their books in the system and the user can see and order books from the website and get it delievered to home.
this is was a class project and there's some features that wasn't completed because of deadlines

the website was built using 
PostgresSql for database,
React for Front End,
and Express for the backend API


will deploy it sometime soon and put the link here for you to give a try
